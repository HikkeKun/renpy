.. function:: renpy.start_predict(*args)
    
    This function takes one or more displayables as arguments. It causes
    Ren'Py to predict those displayables during every interaction until
    the displayables are removed by :func:`renpy.stop_predict`.

.. function:: renpy.start_predict_screen(_screen_name, *args, **kwargs)
    
    Causes Ren'Py to start predicting the screen named `_screen_name`
    will be shown with the given arguments. This replaces  any previous prediction
    of `_screen_name`. To stop predicting a screen, call :func:`renpy.stop_predict_screen`.

.. function:: renpy.stop_predict(*args)
    
    This function takes one or more displayables as arguments. It causes
    Ren'Py to stop predicting those displayables during every interaction.

.. function:: renpy.stop_predict_screen(name)
    
    Causes Ren'Py to stop predicting the screen named `name` will be shown.
